(The version 1.33 of this script is already included in VIM 7.3)

Features:
- Indent "perfectly" PHP code.
- Comment or non-PHP code doesn't break the algorithm.
- Non-PHP code, multiline /**/ comments and "Here Document" content remain unchanged.
- HTML <Script.*> tags are indented as PHP and like if their content was part of the surrounding PHP code.
- Fast optimized indenting, the script knows when it's indenting large blocks and skips some unnecessary tests...
- Support folding (folds don't break the indenting)
- Auto-formatting for comments (using the Vim option formatoptions=qroc).
- Indent correctly complex "non bracketted blocks" (like in language C):

    Example: (start of line spaces are replaced by ____)
<?php
if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) 
____if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) 
________if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) {
____________$History_lst_sel=0;
________} else
____________$foo="truc";
____else
_______$bla= "foo";
$command_hist = TRUE;
?>

- Direct indenting, the text is indented as you type it.
- switch/case are indented correctly.
- Script source code well commented.
- Bug free as far as I know :)

A more complete example of its capabilities:

<?php
if ($foo="thing") // as you see an opened bracket isn't needed to indent correctly :)
____if (foo("something"))
____{
________somethingelse("blabla");
?>


<html>
<head>
<title>SOME HTML CODE</title>
<?
________echo "Something here";
?>
________<script type="text/javascript">
________// Note the indentation of the script as if part of PHP

________var truc=0;
________if (truc) {
____________nothing();
________}

________</script>

</head>
<body>

<b>some closing and oppenning bracket here } } {
nothing to indent here :)
</b>

</body>
</html>


<?
________Somethingelse(true);
____}

if (foo)
____/* a useless comment here
____with useless code:
____if (broken code) {
___________________blabla();
____*/
____if (testHereDocument()) {


________echo <<<HEREDOC
Here is an Here Document style
echo, very useful.
The following code isn't indented
if (test)
while (foo) {
nothing();
}
HEREDOC;

____}

bye();
?>

That's all folks!
